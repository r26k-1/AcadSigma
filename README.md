    1. **Data Ingestion API**: Manages dataset uploads, validation, and preparation.
    2. **AI Analytics API**: Interfaces with AI/ML models to analyze data and return insights.
    3. **Query API**: Allows users to run specific queries on datasets and get real-time insights.

### 3. Data Layer
- **Data Storage**: A distributed database for large-scale data storage.
  - **Database**: PostgreSQL for structured data or MongoDB for NoSQL, supporting large data volumes.
  - **Blob Storage**: AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage for securely storing raw datasets.
- **Data Indexing**: Data is indexed for faster retrieval and search capabilities.
  - **Solution**: Elasticsearch or OpenSearch for efficient searching and querying of large datasets.

### 4. AI/ML Service Layer
- **AI Models**: The core analytics engine, leveraging LLMs and other ML models.
  - **Pre-trained Models**: Use OpenAI's GPT-4 for generating insights or predictive models such as random forests for anomaly detection.
  - **Custom Fine-tuning**: Fine-tune AI models using domain-specific datasets for improved performance.
- **Model Deployment**: Models hosted on cloud platforms such as AWS SageMaker, Azure Machine Learning, or Google Cloud AI.

### 5. Data Processing Pipeline
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean, normalize, and transform datasets before feeding them to AI models.
  - **Tools**: Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation, and PySpark for large-scale data processing.

### 6. Analysis Modules
1. **Predictive Analytics**: Use time series models or regression techniques for forecasting trends.
2. **Pattern Detection**: Apply clustering or classification models to identify patterns or anomalies.
3. **Automated Reporting**: Automatically generate visual insights and analytics reports.
4. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Use LLMs to provide insights or generate summaries of large datasets.

### 7. Security & Compliance
- **Encryption**: Encrypt all data in transit (SSL/TLS) and at rest (AES-256).
- **Access Control**: Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and OAuth2 or JWT for secure access.
- **Compliance**: Ensure compliance with regulations such as GDPR for data privacy.
